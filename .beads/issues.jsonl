Normalization only rebuilds chunk descriptors/props and clears runtime spawn tables.\n- Persisted fields are limited to world seed/chunk config/start biome data, minimap visibility/zoom, visitedChunks, and generatedChunks (biome, transition, descriptors, props, defeatedFoes, lootedStructures). Player state (position, stats, health/mana, XP, potions, skills), inventory/equipment, ground loot, and timers are not saved, so reloads spawn a fresh character into a partially persisted world.\n\nPlan for save data model:\n- Add a schema version and slot metadata to the save payload so future migrations can validate data.\n- Player payload: position, baseStats, health/mana current+max, combat/range, movement (speed/modifiers), experience (level/currentXP/unallocated points), potion counts + cooldownRemaining, skills (equipped slots plus allocations/availablePoints), inventory (full item rolls including affixes/stats/sprite/source/gold), and equipment slot assignments.\n- World payload: chunk config (chunkSize/activeRadius/worldSeed/start biome flags), startBiomeCenter/radius/forceStartBiome, spawnSafeZone, visitedChunks, generatedChunks including zone names, transition data, props, defeatedFoes, and lootedStructures, plus minimap state (visible/zoom). Preserve chunk seeds/zone seeds when present to avoid renaming on reload.\n- Runtime entities: capture ground loot (item/potion/gold with positions and despawn timers) so drops persist across sessions; ignore ephemeral render/physics state that can be recomputed.\n\nIntegration hooks:\n- Extend WorldScene:serializeState to emit the player/world payload and wire a loader path that hydrates Player.new with saved components before applying stats/equipment.\n- Validate decoded saves and provide safe fallbacks so corrupt files or missing fields do not crash load.\n- Coordinate with save slot UI, autosave policy, corruption handling, and main menu load wiring so serialization feeds those features.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-28T07:29:22.022987+01:00","updated_at":"2025-11-28T14:25:17.225576+01:00","closed_at":"2025-11-28T14:25:17.225576+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"Diablo-3hw","depends_on_id":"Diablo-zta","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-11-28T07:29:22.023505+01:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}
