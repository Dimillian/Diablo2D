# Diablo2D

![Diablo2D](screenshot.png)

Top-down action roguelike inspired by Diablo, built with LÖVE (Love2D) and Lua. Explore a procedurally generated forest, fight roaming packs, level up, and gather randomized gear before visiting small towns for vendors and respite.

## Current State
- Homegrown ECS module (`modules/ecs.lua`): reusable entity/component management with efficient component set queries. Any scene can opt into ECS via `ECS.init(scene)`.
- `WorldScene` uses ECS: entities are pure data, systems (`player_input`, `mouse_look`, `mouse_movement`, `movement`, `wander`, `detection`, `chase`, `render`, `starter_gear`) operate on component tables using efficient queries.
- Dual input system: keyboard movement (WASD, Q/Z for AZERTY keyboards) and right-click mouse movement. Mouse look system tracks cursor direction for combat targeting with visual arrow indicator.
- Player combat loop: left-click queues attacks when foes are within range, respects attack speed bonuses, and feeds a combat event queue that downstream systems consume (damage numbers, loot drops, target HUD).
- Starter gear system: automatically generates and equips common-quality weapon and armor (helmet, chest, boots) when world initializes.
- Entity factories (`entities/player.lua`, `entities/foe.lua`) provide consistent creation patterns with configurable properties (speed, detection range, health, etc.).
- AI behavior system: foes detect player within configurable range, switch between wandering and chasing, and now halt just outside the player with a configurable separation buffer. Detection circles visible in debug mode.
- Basic sandbox world with a controllable hero and multiple foes with different speeds and detection ranges.
- Scene manager with stack-based overlays; inventory scene renders as a modal without pausing the world draw order.
- Inventory overlay UI stub (split equipment/inventory columns, translucent backdrop).
- Item generator with slot-aware prefixes/suffixes, rarity weighting, and flexible `ItemGenerator.roll()` API supporting rarity/itemType overrides and source tagging.
- Utility modules: `modules/vector.lua` for vector math (normalize, distance, length); `system_helpers/coordinates.lua` for screen-to-world coordinate conversion.
- Debug mode: press 't' to toggle debug visualization (detection circles). Debug status displayed in top-right corner.
- UI: health bar positioned in bottom-left corner; debug status in top-right corner; mouse look direction arrow indicator around player; enemy target frame with improved spacing between name and health bar.

### Combat Snapshot
- `systems/combat.lua` processes queued attacks, clamps melee overlap, applies stat-aware damage/crit rolls, and raises structured events (`damage`, `death`) that other systems subscribe to.
- Damage events spawn floating numbers with crit tinting while death events hand off to the loot dropper, which rolls gear via the shared item generator and ensures pickup metadata (radius, timers) is attached.
- `systems/player_attack.lua` integrates the targeting helper to maintain a sticky foe selection, enforces attack cooldowns derived from player stats, and only queues strikes when the foe is alive and within effective range.
- Loot pickup respects cursor hover plus proximity before pulling items into the inventory/equipment helper, preventing accidental looting mid-fight.

## Feature Targets (Early Phase)
- Procedural forest overworld with repeatable runs.
- Combat against monster packs with XP and leveling.
- Random loot feeding inventory and equipment.
- Small towns containing NPC vendors and shops.

## Getting Started
1. Install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) 11.x or later.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run `love .` from the project root, or open the bundled `Diablo.love` directly with LÖVE.

## Roadmap
- Expand ECS scaffolding: additional components (combat stats, damage), and system registry utilities.
- Extend foe types: create specialized foe factories with varied detection ranges, speeds, and behaviors.
- Hook inventory/equipment data into the UI, add interactions (equip, drop, compare).
- Prototype procedural world generation and encounter spawning.
- Implement combat loop, loot tables, and progression pacing.
